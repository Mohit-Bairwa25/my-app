import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

  return (
    <>
      <Router>
        <Navbar title="TEXT UTILS 2.0" aboutCompany="Text Form" mode={mode} toggleMode={toggleMode}/>
        <div className="container my-5">
        <Alert alert={alert} mode={mode} toggleMode={toggleMode}/>
            <Routes>
              <Route path="/homepage" element={<Homepage />} />
              <Route path="/TextForm" 
              element={<TextForm showAlert={showAlert} heading="Write Your Analyzing Text" mode={mode} toggleMode={toggleMode}/>} />
              <Route path="/About" element={<About />} />
            </Routes>
          </div>
        </Router>
    </>
  );
}

For Routing He Has used Switches we have used Routes {May Be Thats why we are not faceing the propblem he has 
or there may has an update in react that has resolved this issue}

Upgrade to react-router-dom version 6 and update your route syntax:
First, install version 6:
Copy
npm install react-router-dom@latest

Go to this Link
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages

Step 1: Add homepage to package.json
"homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",

{
  "homepage": "https://Mohit-Bairwa25.github.io/React-NewsBUS-Stop",
  "name": "react-understanding",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,

  Step 2: Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in package.json

  npm install --save gh-pages

  Add the following scripts in your package.json:

    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",

    "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",

    "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",

After this, 
git add .
git commit -m "Valuable Message"
git push origin main


Step 3: Deploy the site by running npm run deploy
npm run deploy

Go to this Link
https://github.com/Mohit-Bairwa25/React-NewsBUS-Stop/settings
make sure branch is gh-pages

Now this is a working Link

If you're still encountering issues, you might need to clear your npm cache:
npm cache clean --force
npm update
npm install react-scripts@latest
