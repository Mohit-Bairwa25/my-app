Step 1: Add homepage to package.json
"homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",

{
  "homepage": "https://Mohit-Bairwa25.github.io/React-Notebook",
  "name": "react-understanding",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,

  Step 2: Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in package.json

  npm install --save gh-pages

  Add the following scripts in your package.json:

    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",

    "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",

    "scripts": {
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",

After this, 
git add .
git commit -m "Valuable Message"
git push origin main


Step 3: Deploy the site by running npm run deploy
npm run deploy
